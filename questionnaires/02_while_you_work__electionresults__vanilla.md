# While you work Questionaire

COPY THIS FILE FOR YOUR COMPONENT AND VARIATION!

This questionaire is supposed to log your experiences while working on a component.

Please write down anything that comes up during development of a component.

This includes among others

- What went well
- what went badly
- problems with componer
- problems with components
- ...

### 1. Was the documentation of this component understandable? If no, what was problematic?

~ The documentation could be a bit more clear on the return data format ~

### 2. How long did each stage take you to implement?

- stage1: 3h
- stage2: 0.05h
- stage3: 0.45h

### 3. Was the difficulty rating matching what the component asked? If no, why not and how would you rate it?

~  I found it more difficult than the rating. But my main trouble was with the return data and that I did't work with JSON Objects in a while, so in retrospect, the rating probably fits.
I would maybe raste it 3-4 ~

### 4. Did you know the concepts used in this component before implementing?

~ no, I hadn't combined async function and interval before
    I didn't try dinamic graphs before~

### 5. If you used a build pipeline, what did you use and did you have problems setting it up?

~ didn't use anything ~

### 6. How would you rate the developer experience of this variation compared to the others?

~  -~

### 7. If you could add, remove or change one stage of this component, which would it be, how and why?

~ I would maybe separate the first stage into more stages~

### 8. If you'd need to choose one variant to implement this component again, which would you choose?

~ your answer here ~
