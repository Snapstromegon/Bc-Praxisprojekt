# Before You Start

## Install the necessary Tools

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (the version should be LTS or Current - both are fine)
- Make sure NodeJS and NPM are installed correctly by running
  - ```node --version```
  - ```npm --version```
- Make sure that you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (it's free)

## Get Your Copy

Open the [Snapstromegon/Bc-Praxisprojekt](https://github.com/Snapstromegon/Bc-Praxisprojekt) Repository and fork it according to [this guide](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/) and do steps 1-4 (the branch name doesn't matter).

## Prepare the project

### Install packages

Inside the **"componer"** folder, install the required packages by running ```npm install```

### Start the live server

Inside the **"componer"** folder, run ```npm run serve``` to start a local webserver.

It will display a link to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) which you can open in your browser.

This will show you the same page as here, just on your local machine with your solutions.

## Up Next

Now that you're ready, go on and [start your work](../createYourContribution).
