# While you work Questionaire

COPY THIS FILE FOR YOUR COMPONENT AND VARIATION!

This questionaire is supposed to log your experiences while working on a component.

Please write down anything that comes up during development of a component.

This includes among others

- What went well
- what went badly
- problems with componer
- problems with components
- ...

### 1. Was the documentation of this component understandable? If no, what was problematic?

It was understandable. I just had a problem regarding reloading / css that I did not get at first, see 7.

Also, as I rarely do web dev stuff, I more or less have to look up everything (in this case: button callbacks to make sure I'm not doing something wrong, although I would have been able to do it without looking it up as well)

### 2. How long did each stage take you to implement?

- stage1: 2min
- stage2: 8min
- stage3: 2.5min

### 3. Was the difficulty rating matching what the component asked? If no, why not and how would you rate it?

Yes - it's very easy

### 4. Did you know the concepts used in this component before implementing?

Yes

### 5. If you used a build pipeline, what did you use and did you have problems setting it up?

Used none

### 6. How would you rate the developer experience of this variation compared to the others?

Using vanilla JS is quite simple here - using / setting up non-vanilla variations for such low-effort tasks would be 'overkill'

### 7. If you could add, remove or change one stage of this component, which would it be, how and why?

For me, the site only reloads if the .html file gets changed, so it took a while until I understood why the style.css "did not work".

If that behavior is known, adding a warning might be nice. Else... well, now you know that that can happen I guess

### 8. If you'd need to choose one variant to implement this component again, which would you choose?

Vanilla, even though I haven't tried out the others yet. I'm vaguely familiar with Vue at best, and not at all with React, so setting them up will take a while.


### Filling this questionaire took me this long:
4 minutes

### Implementing this component in this variation took me this long:
12.5 minutes (due to the problem mentioned in 7 and 1)
