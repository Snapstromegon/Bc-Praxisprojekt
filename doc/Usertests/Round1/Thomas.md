## Install Deps

### NodeJS

- No Problems except Native Server Tools required or not?

### Clone

- That Componer is not root is a little annoying

### NPM

- if nodejs is newly installed npm might not work until editor restart
- write that nopm run serve doesn't stop and how to stop it

## First touch

- Make Start the top nav item
- Discribe what the target of this project is
- fill stars from left to right

## Readme Component

- remove auto reloading for component descriptions during implementation
- Readme mention of output folder needs to be explained
- explain where to link to style from
- style not working (watchtarget seems to not work correctly)

Problems were more the lack of Web Dev experience
