# Before you start Questionaire

## Introduction

This questionaire is meant to log what your experience with webdevelopment and programming in general is.
Please answer theese question open and honestly. I won't judge you based on your answers, it just helps me to compare solutions and experiences.

I will use your answers in my paper, but I will anonymise your contributions.

Please don't change your answers here after finishing it the first time. Also you don't need to think that much about most questions here.

### Look at the time

Please record the time you took for each component and variant to implement.

The last question of each questionaire will be how much time it took you to work through the tasks and the questionaire. I don't need exact values, but the differences between variations and the ballpark of the values are important to me to adapt the tasks.
