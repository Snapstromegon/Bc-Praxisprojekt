# While you work Questionaire

COPY THIS FILE FOR YOUR COMPONENT AND VARIATION!

This questionaire is supposed to log your experiences while working on a component.

Please write down anything that comes up during development of a component.

This includes among others

- What went well
- what went badly
- problems with componer
- problems with components
- ...

### 1. Was the documentation of this component understandable? If no, what was problematic?

~ stage3 were instructions a bit unclear but ultimately     everything was understandable.
    Instructions could include formula for computing musical bars from bpm ~

### 2. How long did each stage take you to implement?

- stage1: 1h
- stage2: 0.05h
- stage3: 0.40h
- stage4: 1.15h
- stage5: 0.05h

### 3. Was the difficulty rating matching what the component asked? If no, why not and how would you rate it?

~ yes. Maybe a bit lower. I found this component esiear than "electionresults" which was higher in difficulty rating ~

### 4. Did you know the concepts used in this component before implementing?

~   Yes, mostly, though not in this combination.
    I had never computed musical bars and had to look up the formulas~

### 5. If you used a build pipeline, what did you use and did you have problems setting it up?

~ didn't use anything ~

### 6. How would you rate the developer experience of this variation compared to the others?

~ Simple and straightforward. I liked it.~

### 7. If you could add, remove or change one stage of this component, which would it be, how and why?

~~ I would remove stage2 and add its contents to stage1.
The slidebar and numberinput from stage1 and 2 could easily be in the same stage~

### 8. If you'd need to choose one variant to implement this component again, which would you choose?

~ vanilla ~
