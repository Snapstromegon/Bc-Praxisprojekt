This questionaire is supposed to log what you think after you're done with everything you want to contribute.

## Comparison to "01_before_you_start"

### 1. Compared to the first questionaire, how would you rate your frontend web development expierience now?

~ I would rate it less highly ~

### 2. While implementing did you try frameworks you never used before and if yes, which?

~ I tried react, which I havent used before ~

### 3. Comparing all components you implemented, which variation was the easiest to implement and in your opinion what's the reason for it?

~ vanilla js. In my opinion because I have experience with it, whcih wasn't the case for the framework I used~

### 4. Comparing across all variations, which variation was the easiest and hardest to use with componer and why?

~ Vanilla was easiest to use and straightforward to integrate into componer. TReact was also easy to integrate into componer but not as easy to use for me. 
I wanted to use Vue as well, but was unable to integrate it into componer, which is why I din't include it at all.

### 5. Did components not fit into the context of the others regarding their difficulty rating and if so, which and how would you rate them and why?
