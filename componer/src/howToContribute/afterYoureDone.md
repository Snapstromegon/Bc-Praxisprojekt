# After You're Done

## One last questionaire

If you haven't already, please fill in the last questionaire (**questionaires/03_when_youre_done.md**).

## Create a Pull Request

Now that you're done and answered all questionaires, create a Pull Request using step 6-7 of [this guide](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/).

Don't be surprised that I won't merge your PR and feel free to update it if you want to contribute more. Just push to the same branch again.
