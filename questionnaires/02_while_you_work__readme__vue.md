# While you work Questionaire

COPY THIS FILE FOR YOUR COMPONENT AND VARIATION!

This questionaire is supposed to log your experiences while working on a component.

Please write down anything that comes up during development of a component.

This includes among others

- What went well
- what went badly
- problems with componer
- problems with components
- ...

### 1. Was the documentation of this component understandable? If no, what was problematic?

The documentation was okay, as before

But: I'm not really used to using Vue yet, so setting everything up took a while, and I'm very sure that I'm abusing its syntax

### 2. How long did each stage take you to implement?

- stage1, including preparation: 27min
- stage2: 2min
- stage3: 2min

### 3. Was the difficulty rating matching what the component asked? If no, why not and how would you rate it?

My answer is still yes - the problem that I have with Vue or any other framework is mostly setting it up properly. I never set up Vue myself before, and in this use context I also have to use other methods because I would not know how to use the 'compiling version' of Vue and thus used the ES6 Module version instead. Also, I'm used to using .vue files with templates, but I did not know how to get these to run as they, as far as I know, must be compiled. 

But that's my problem, implementing the task itself is not hard as soon as you know how to use Vue.

### 4. Did you know the concepts used in this component before implementing?

Regarding Vue: Partially no, partially forgotten

### 5. If you used a build pipeline, what did you use and did you have problems setting it up?

I used none, Vue is imported for ES6 Modules from unpkg. I also wouldn't know how to use one, so...

### 6. How would you rate the developer experience of this variation compared to the others?

If I knew how to use and set up Vue properly, it might be similar to the vanilla one. But to be honest: I did not like it exactly because I don't know how to properly set it up. There also seem to be so many variants of doing it that I would always be afraid to do it in a wrong way, that I would abuse the notation or be inefficient.

### 7. If you could add, remove or change one stage of this component, which would it be, how and why?

Well, I would say I am not really the right audience, due to lack of experience regarding JS frameworks. Otherwise, a small explanation or example of how to set up e.g. Vue would be nice. (E.g. if I need to install packages via npm, how to set up the folder structure etc.)

### 8. If you'd need to choose one variant to implement this component again, which would you choose?

Definitely vanilla, as anything else would very likely be both badly implemented and involve a lot of googling
